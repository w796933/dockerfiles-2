## docker-weevely

Weevely is a command line web shell dynamically extended over the network at runtime,
designed for remote administration and pen testing. It provides a weaponized, telnet-like
console through a PHP script running on the target, even in restricted environments.

See [weevely.sh](https://github.com/Nightling/dockerfiles/blob/master/weevely/weevely.sh)
for a complete example of running [Weevely](https://github.com/epinna/weevely3) in a container.
